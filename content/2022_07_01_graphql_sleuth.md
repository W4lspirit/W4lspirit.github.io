# Disclaimer

This is my first blog post. :D

# Context

I just started a new project at work, where we need to provide GraphQL service for part of our 'Storage Engine'.

In a previous project, I used [Sangria](https://sangria-graphql.github.io/) a Scala Graphql implementation but since we
are more of a Java/Spring-boot shop, we decided on using the [DGS Framework](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/) which has
been open-sourced by Netflix early 2021.

DGS is built with SpringBoot & [graphql-java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java.) & support the Spring Boot
Reactive stack aka Webflux .

## Observability

All of our Spring Boot services have distributed tracing enabled
via [spring-cloud-starter-sleuth](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-sleuth).
Spring Cloud Sleuth is a distributed tracing framework for Spring Boot and provide instrumentation on many
libraries : [available instrumentation](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/tree/3.1.x/spring-cloud-sleuth-instrumentation/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/instrument)
.

For example in this project, we are using Webflux, r2dbc-postgresql([https://r2dbc.io/](https://r2dbc.io/)) and
transaction management which have been instrumented in Sleuth.

# Problem

I wrote my integration tests for each use case and implemented the first graphql query.
All the tests were failing (404 _not a good start_).

In these integrations test, I was calling the server with GET request since that is how I was writing them for my
Sangria project.

Seems like DGS is not serving GET request.

List of http endpoint exposed by the service :

Route definition in DGS :
![kotlin code showing the definition of the /POST route for path /graphql](/img/dgs_route.png)

Switching to POST request, I was getting different errors (graphql-errors).

I enabled the tracing in the integration tests to check if the different services were being called.

There was something strange in these traces, there was no information about the graphql query processed by the engine
nor the trace of a call to the engine.

I could only see the call to POST /graphql and the call to the database.

_(I did find the cause of the failing test and fix it)_

# Research

With a quick search on the DGS documentation,
we have
more [information](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/advanced/instrumentation/#adding-instrumentation-for-tracing-and-logging)
there is no default tracing implementation for the GraphQL engine.

We must implement it by extending the SimpleInstrumentation from the graphql-java library.

```java

@Component
public class ExampleTracingInstrumentation extends SimpleInstrumentation {
}
```

_Internal monolog_

_Hmm maybe someone already did that for Sleuth_

I checked the issues and the list of available instrumentation in the Sleuth repository. I didn't find any .

I searched on google nothing...

_Maybe someone else did it for another tracing framework, Open-telemetry(Otel) ?_

_hmmm maybe I should check that._

I searched 'opentelemetry graphql java' and found there was a maven artefact.

![Search result](/img/search-opentelementry-graphql-java.png)

I checked the GitHub repository and found the instrumentation code for graphql-java
[https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation/graphql-java-12.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation/graphql-java-12.0)

# Solution

Now I have an instrumentation for the GraphQL engine, I should be able to use it.

_Not so fast_, I need the instrumentation code to be compatible with Sleuth instrumentation & API.

_I could write a bridge open-telemetry to Sleuth ?_

_Bad idea!_

Thankfully this work is in progress by the Spring Cloud Team, but it's in the experimental
repository [https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-cloud-sleuth-otel](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-cloud-sleuth-otel)
.

I should find another way, instead of creating a bridge I should translate the instrumentation code written with
Open-telemetry Api with Sleuth API.

The apis are not identical since Sleuth historically has inherited some design from OpenZikpin/Brave library /
OpenTracing era and Open-telemetry being the new standard.

The implementation is available bellow:

# The end

Just wanted to share a little about Graphql Java Instrumentation.
